  <h3>Emergency Notification System</h3>
  <p>Reserve Township is required by the Environmental Protection Administration to establish an Emergency Notification System. Reserve Township has contracted the services of CODE RED for a Community Alerting System that may be used to notify all residents of Reserve Township in the event of an emergency. We have also contracted with Verizon to obtain the 9-1-1 Database. This database contains every Verizon direct dial landline telephone number in Reserve Township. The Verizon 9-1-1 Database at this time does not capture cellular phones, Non-Verizon phone service providers, or some Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) phone numbers. This registration process will allow you to register your Phone Service Provider, cellular, and/or VOIP phone numbers with your address. This will ensure that you are on the list to receive notifications from our Community Alerting System.</p>

  <p>The Community Alerting System is an automated system that calls homes and businesses to notify them about serious emergencies or notifications. The system will also direct you to take specific actions during an emergency.</p>

  <p>In the event of an emergency, public safety personnel will identify the affected area of Reserve Township and activate the system. It will automatically call all telephone numbers within a specified area and deliver a recorded message.</p>

  <p>Uses for the Community Alerting System may include but are not limited to the following:

  <ul>
	  <li>Water Line Service Interruptions or Notifications</li>
	  <li>Missing Person or Amber Alerts</li>
	  <li>Emergency Evacuations</li>
	  <li>Local Security &amp; Crime Alerts</li>
	  <li>Weather Emergencies</li>
  </ul>
